# Bash_projects

This repository is a collection of various scripts I have written in Bash for school purposes.

## Finder

This script reads lines of input and for every line starting with "FILE 'local_or_relative_path'" determines, whether the entered path is actually a file. There is 4 options, -h to see them all.

## PDF files locator

Use this script to find links to PDF files in HTML file locally or remotely. Use -h for more info
